# Prestige Script:

__**What is it?**__
- This is a script used for a minecraft box server. It was for player's who got to a certant level and they could prestige. And it would remove the level's from the player at a cost of the balance.

__**Installation:**__

- In your server, locate `/plugins/script/scripts/` and put the file inside of there if that is the directory you want to use.
- If you want to use your own level script please change the variable in your file from `{levels::%player%::level}` to your variable.

__**Dependencies:**__

- Skript
- SkBee
